The application's proper functionality is not ensured with outdated versions of Node.js, Angular CLI, or npm. Please ensure that you have the appropriate versions installed to guarantee smooth operation of the application.

## 🛠️ Installation

Steps to install and configure the application locally in a development environment

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the ```command npm install``` to install project dependencies.
3. Run the command ```npm run start``` to start the development server.
4. Open your web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:4200 to see the application in action.

**Note**: To build the application for production deployment on a web server, you need to run the command ```ng build --configuration=production```. This will generate a folder called dist, which you should upload to your web server. Inside that folder, create a file called robots.txt and add the following line: ```User-agent: *```. With this, you have everything you need to upload your website to a server of your choice.
